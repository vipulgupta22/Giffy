A GIF (Graphical Interchange Format) is an image format invented in 1987 by Steve Wilhite, a US software writer who was looking for a way to animate images in the smallest file size. In short, GIFs are a series of images or soundless video that will loop continuously and doesnâ€™t require anyone to press play. This repetition makes GIFs feel immediately familiar, like the beat of a song.
The purpose of this GIFFY is that it provides most of the basic functionality to find a GIF. It allows the person or user can find the animated GIFs or stickers or memes and can use it. Once the user search foe a GIF or Stickers or Memes then the system show the related gifs of the searches.
